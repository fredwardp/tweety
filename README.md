# Tweety - A Fullstack Twitter Clone

Tweety is a full-featured Twitter clone built with modern web development technologies. This project showcases the implementation of a social media platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The design inspiration was taken from a Dribbble concept, and the project is developed as a desktop application. One of the key learnings in this project was implementing a "Login with Google" authentication feature.
